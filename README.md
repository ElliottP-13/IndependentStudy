# Machine Learning for Diabetes Insulin Ratios
This is an independent study project during Fall 2021 at Montana State University.
The purpose of this project is to apply machine learning to diabetes health data.
I will use new methods in transductive reinforcement learning and/or transfer learning
 and apply them to this area.

The hypothesis tested is that a model trained on general/combined data can be 
fine-tuned on user specific data with better performance and less data.

T1D_VPP is from Dr. Peter Jacobs' implementation [found here](https://github.com/petejacobs/T1D_VPP).
It is from a Paper by Resalat et al "A statistical virtual patient population for the glucoregulatory system in type 1 
diabetes with integrated exercise model".
This is used in my work to model blood glucose dynamics with given insulin regimines.
